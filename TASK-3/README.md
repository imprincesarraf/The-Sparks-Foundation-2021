 <h3>Problem statement</h3>As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit
 <li>Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset SampleSuperstore in jupyter notebook.Using Univariate and Bivariate analysis, I concluded following steps need to be taken to make more profit are-: <ol> <li>
  The sales of tables should be stopped as it is producing high loss</li> <li>
 Bookcases and Supplies are producing negligible loss so their price should be increased</li><li>
 The price of Furniture should be increased as sales is High but profit is lowest</li><li>
 Furniture is making loss from Central region so price should be increased specially in central region</li><li> Texas, Arizona,Colorado,Flordia,IIinois,North Carolina,Ohio,Pennsylvania,Tennessee these states are giving loss even when the sale is good the region behind these losses are high discounts.So we need to reduce the discount in these states to make profit</li></ol> </li>
